# E05a-Animation

We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.

When you are done, main1.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

For extra credit, you could create a main3.py that contains the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation](http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation). Download sprite assets for the player and coins and figure out how to make your character walk left and right.


Main.py1 programmed a ball to follow the mouse and whenever the mouse is clicked the ball will turn black and whenever the mouse is not being clicked the ball will be red. Main.py2 allows users to control the ball with the arrow keys in the arcade window.
